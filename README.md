Walmart Sales Forecasting

[Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting](https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting/data) 

To approach this problem, we first visualized our data which can be seen in the [Vizualization notebook](https://github.com/EricYangg/4AI3-Walmart-Forecast/blob/main/Dataset%20Visualization.ipynb) 

We then combined all the useful datasets for training and pre-processed our data to be used to train and validate our models in the [Pre-processing](https://github.com/EricYangg/4AI3-Walmart-Forecast/blob/main/Pre-processing.ipynb) notebook and the final train and test datasets are saved in our [Processed Dataset Update Folder](https://github.com/EricYangg/4AI3-Walmart-Forecast/tree/main/Processed%20Dataset%20Update)

For our models the main ones that performed best in out of the ones we tested were [Linear Regression](https://github.com/EricYangg/4AI3-Walmart-Forecast/blob/main/Linear%20Regression.ipynb) and [Ransac](https://github.com/EricYangg/4AI3-Walmart-Forecast/blob/main/Walmart_RANSAC.ipynb). We did also explore other models, however, their performance either was either close or a lot worse than the two models mentioned before. Our submission files have been saved under the [Submission Folder](https://github.com/EricYangg/4AI3-Walmart-Forecast/tree/main/Submission%20Files)
